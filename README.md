package.json is configuration for npm
this packages some times called as dependencies
npm will take care what is the version of that package
the most important dependency in our project is bundler
what is bundler?
 a) bundler make our files(app.ja,css,index) combined together.
 parcel is one of the important liabrary
 parcel will come from node package
 2 types of dependencis is there 1. dev dependency
                                  2. normal dependency
     
caret and tilde diff?
  a)caret symble helps the automatically updated the actull version
  if verion is updated.
  if we put tilde it will just installed major version automatically
  caret always good for upgrade minor versons(tilde is for major versions)
  package lock.json locks the present version(keep a track of exact version).
  node modules contain all the code that we fetch from npm
  node modules like as database
  parcel need its own dependency and that dependencies need their own
  dependency so this is called transitive dependency.
  parcel uses babel
